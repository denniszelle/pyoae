"""
This module provides functionality for managing microphone calibration data.

It enables amplitude correction of recorded signals by applying
frequency-dependent scaling and phase-correction based on a stored calibration
curve, supporting accurate pressure-level measurements in OAE recordings.

Note:
    This is a dummy module. Functionality will be added in future revisions.â€š
